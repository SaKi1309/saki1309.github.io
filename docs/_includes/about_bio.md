### Biography

I was born in 1993 in [Baden-Baden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden) which is located in the southern part of Germany. 

In 2013 I moved to the Stuttgart area and 2016 I graduated my bachelor in electrical engineering at 
the [Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW)](https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de/horb/en/). Its a special program in Germany, where
you study and work at the time gaining practical experience very soon. 

After I finnished my studies I stayed an aditional year in the company, working as a software and hardware engineer. I was part of the [MIPI Alliance](https://www.mipi.org/) 
working on the defenition of high speed communication standards. I had the chance as a young engineer, traveling to face2face conferences arround the globe.

In the end 2017 I changed to Bosch to become a hardware engineer for [automotive radar electronics](https://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/solutions/sensors/front-radar-sensor/) 
electronics and soon after, in 2019 I became the technical project lead for automotive radar electronics. At this time I was only 25 years old and I had felt an internal urge
to continue studying. Since I had a great job and a hypotheke waiting, I wanted to keep on working and study at the same time. Through my spanish wife, I found the 
[National University of Distance Education (UNED)](https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/) in Madrid, Spain. I graduated my master in electronic systems for information 
and communication in 2021. 

In June 2021 I got the great honor to be induced into [IEEE Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.ieee.org/), the international honor society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). 
The organization promotes excellence in the profession and in education through an emphasis on scholarship, character, and attitude.

It was during that time where I discovered my new passion: machine learning. It combined everything I was interested in: math, software, hardware and complexity.
This new passion drove me to start my PhD in machine learning in 2021.
