Welcome to my personal space!

#### Current Activities
I recently started my PhD in the domain of machine learning at the <a href="https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/" target="_blank">National University of Distance Education (UNED)</a> in Madrid, Spain.
At the moment I am focusing on finding a specific research topic. Since November 2021, I have joined the conferences Nvidia GTC21, <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021" target="_blank">Neurips21</a> 
and <a href="https://wacv2021.thecvf.com/home" target="_blank">WACV21</a> to gain further insights on the field.
