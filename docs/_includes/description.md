Welcome to my personal space! 

On this page you will encounter updates on my academic and professional life. 
Furthermore, I linked all my social media channels and my medium blog. 


#### Current Activities
I recently started my PhD in the domain of machine learning at the [National University of Distance Education (UNED)](https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/) in Madrid, Spain.
My focus is currently on finding a specific research topic. Since November I have joined Nvidia GTC21, [Neurips21](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021) and 
[WACV21](https://wacv2021.thecvf.com/home) to gain further insights on the field.
