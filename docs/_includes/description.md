Welcome to my personal space! 

Here you will find information about my academic and professional activities. 
My social media profiles are linked to the navigation menu. I also added feeds to my GitHub, Stackoverflow and Medium Blog to this website. 


#### Current Activities
I recently started my PhD in the domain of machine learning at the [National University of Distance Education (UNED)](https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/) in Madrid, Spain.
At the moment I am focusing on finding a specific research topic. Since November I have joined Nvidia GTC21, [Neurips21](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021) and 
[WACV21](https://wacv2021.thecvf.com/home) to gain further insights on the field.
