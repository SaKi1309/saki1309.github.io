### Private Life
Up until now you must be thinking that all my activities are related to my academic and professional career or my geeky hobbies. I also like doing sports, traveling, and changing diapers. 
Joke aside, I am a proud dad of my recently born son and a grateful husband of my lovely wife! 

I tried many sports ranging from soccer over bouldern to thaiboxing. But two sports have been around for years: basketball and hitting the gym. I always loved playing basketball for playing in 
a team and the high dynamics of a game. You could lead by 20 points and suddenly after 2 min be 10 points behind and still decide the game for you in the las 10 sec. 
The more focused I got with my studies to more I shifted from playing in a team where a fixed schedule dominated the week, to going to the gym where I could use my time more flexible. There were times I went six times
a week and then other times (like probably now), where I skipped for a whole year. But it does not matter how often I took a break, every time I started again, I was in better shape,
as in the phase before. Once the discipline paid off, it became an addiction and it was always great to let your mind float, forgetting the complicated stuff.
The probably highest adrenalin burst though, I had when I did a parachute jump and had to land by my own or the day I went bungy jumping. If you haven’t done it yet, you should absolutely try it! 

Due to my early job and later with my wife, I have traveled quite some countries. Without any doubt, my favorite trip was to Argentina. The variety of these beautiful landscapes, the colorfulness of Buenos Aires
the mind-blowing masses of water in Iguazú or the impressive vastness of Patagonia stick in my mind like photographs.
