### Private Life
Not all my hobbies are related to my academic and professional career or my geeky hobbies. I also like doing sports, traveling and changing diapers. 
Joke aside, I am a proud dad of my recently born son and a greatful husband of my lovely wife! 

I tried many sports ranging from soccer over bouldern to thaiboxing. But two sports have been arround for years: Basketball and hitting the Gym. I always loved playing basketball for playingin
a team and the high dynamics of a game. You could lead by 20 points and suddenly after 2min be 10 points behind and still decide the game for you in the las 10sec. 
The focused I get with my studies to more I shifted from playing in a team with a fixed schedule, to going to the gym when ever I had some time. There were times I went six times
a week and then other times (like probably now), where I skipped for a whole year. But it does not matter how often I took a break, everytime I started again I was in better shape,
as in the phase before. Once the discipline paid off, it became an addiction and it was always great to let your mind float, forgetting the complicated stuff.

Due to my early job and later with my wife, I have seen quite some countries. Without any doubt, my favorite trip was to Argentina. The variarty of these beautiful landscapes, the colorfulness of Buenos Aires
the mindblowing masses of water in Iguaz√∫ or the impressive vastness of Patagonia stick in my mind like photographs.
