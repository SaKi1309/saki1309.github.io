### Research
Together with the Irish company [Volograms](https://www.volograms.com/) I have worked on adversarial domain adaptation of 3D data to train a volumetric video generator.
We implemented a novel CycleGAN architecture to synthetically generate training samples, which we then used to train a model that reconstructs 3D data from single images.
We are currently writing on our paper and plan to publish soon.
 
In the scope of my PhD, I am in the phase of finding my field of research. I've attended several conferences and have studied a vast number of papers. I have several topics in my 
mind that I want to include from which I think will be important in a future for machine learning research and also for trends in our society. 
I am still not certain to decide on a final topic, because of several reasons:

1. There are so many mind-blowing and interesting research topics in the field of machine learning, it's just not easy to decide.
2. I have limited resources, temporal as monetary. It's simply not possible for me to train multi-trillion parameter models such as OpenAI or Google do.
3. Even if I could train such models, I fear I could not keep pace with the big companies and that I would have a hard time getting my papers accepted.
4. I'd like to apply my expertise in the field of electronics but haven't figured yet how this could work in detail.

At the same time, I see restrictions as a great chance. I believe creativity and methodology are key to overcome these restrictions and hence will result in great findings pushing 
forward the state-of-the-art. 
To follow recent trends in the community, to apply my electronics knowledge and to overcome the restrictions above I'd like to work on self-supervised multi-modal embedded machine 
learning. If you have an idea or looking for collaborations, please contact me!
