### Research
Together with the Irish company [Volograms](https://www.volograms.com/) I have worked on adversarial domain adaptation of 3D data to train a volumetric video generator.
We implemented a novel CycleGAN architecture to synthetically generate training samples, which we then used to train a model that reconstructs 3D data from single images.
We are currently writing a research paper and plan to publish soon.
 
In the scope of my PhD, I am in the phase of finding my field of research. I've attended several conferences and have read through a vast number of papers. I have several topics in 
mind that I would like to cover. I pursue to find a topic that have relevance in the future of machine learning and that implies a rising trend in the society. 
I am still not certain to decide on a final topic, because of several reasons:

1. There are many mind-blowing and interesting research topics in the field of machine learning. It's not easy to decide.
2. I have limited resources, temporal as monetary. It's not possible for me to train multi-billion parameter models as done by OpenAI or Google.
3. Even if I could train such models, I am doubting I could keep pace with the big companies. They have more resources and I would have a hard time getting my papers accepted, because they might not be state of the art.
4. I'd like to apply my expertise in the field of electronics but haven't figured out yet how to merge these two topics.

At the same time, I see these restrictions as a great chance. I believe creativity and methodology are key to overcome these restrictions. In this way you are challenged to find other ways pushing forward the state-of-the-art. 
To follow recent trends in the community, to apply my electronics knowledge and to overcome the restrictions above; I'd like to work on self-supervised multi-modal embedded machine 
learning. If you have an idea or looking for collaborations, please contact me!
