#### Current Activities
I am currently pursuing my PhD in the field of generative multi-modal deep learning at the <a href="https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/" target="_blank">National University of Distance Education (UNED)</a> in Madrid, Spain.
At the moment I am focusing on writing my state-of-the-art on the depth estimation of a scene from multiple sensor modalities.
