Together with the Irish company <a href="https://www.volograms.com/" target="_blank">Volograms</a> I have worked on adversarial domain adaptation of 3D data to train a volumetric video generator.
We implemented a novel CycleGAN architecture to synthetically generate training samples, which we then used to train a model that reconstructs 3D data from single images.
We are currently writing a research paper and plan to publish soon.
 
In the scope of my PhD, I am currently working on the state-of-the-art. 
I have attended several conferences studied a vast number of papers and evaluated many possible fields to study. It took me some time to come up with a suitable topic since many restrictions apply to my PhD due to limited access to resources.

At the same time, I see these restrictions as a great chance. I believe creativity and methodology are key to overcome these restrictions. In this way one is challenged to find other ways pushing forward the state-of-the-art. 

To follow recent trends in the machine learning community and to include my knowledge about electronics and sensors, I would like to work on self-supervised multi-modal generative machine learning. 

Once I proceed with my state-of-the-art, I will post an update.
