My research focuses on multi-modal generative deep learning, primarily using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models.

Together with the Irish company <a href="https://www.volograms.com/" target="_blank">Volograms</a> I have worked on adversarial domain adaptation of 3D data to train a volumetric video generator.
We implemented a novel CycleGAN architecture, the VoloGAN, to synthetically generate training samples, which we then used to train a model for single-view 3D reconstruction. 
Our results are published in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09204" target="_blank">VoloGAN: Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Synthetic Depth Data</a>.

I am currently working on two publications. 

First, we are performing a survey on multi-modal generative deeplearning approaches for the depth estimation of complex scenes such as in autonomous driving scenarios with multiple sensors and multiple views. 

Second, we are investigating denoising diffusion probabilistic models for data generation in the field of augmented/virtual reality applications such as the metaverse.  

I frequently attend conferences to stay up to date with the latest research in the field of deep learning. A record of conferences I attended is found <a href="https://sascha-kirch.github.io/conferences.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Finally, I recently started a new position as lecturer at the Spanish distance university UNED for the subject "Redes neuronales en control industrial" (eng: Neuronal networks in industrial control systems).
