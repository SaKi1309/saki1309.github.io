My research focuses on multi-modal generative deep learning, primarily using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models.

Over the last several years I have been a colaborative researcher together with <a href="https://www.volograms.com/" target="_blank">Volograms</a>. We have worked on multiple projects that resulted in two publications. In our first project we have implemented adversarial domain adaptation of 3D data to train a volumetric video generator.
We designed a novel CycleGAN architecture, the VoloGAN, to synthetically generate training samples, which we then used to train a model for single-view 3D reconstruction. Our results are published in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09204" target="_blank">VoloGAN: Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Synthetic Depth Data</a>.
In our second project we performed monocular depth estimation and depth super-resolution applying conditional diffusion probabilistic models. Or results have been published in the paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239167" target="_blank">RGB-D-Fusion: Image Conditioned Depth Diffusion of Humanoid Subjects</a>.

I frequently attend conferences and events to stay up to date with the latest research in the field of deep learning. A record of events I attended is found <a href="https://sascha-kirch.github.io/events.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Finally, I recently started a new position as lecturer at the Spanish distance university UNED for the subject "Redes neuronales en control industrial" (eng: Neuronal networks in industrial control systems).
